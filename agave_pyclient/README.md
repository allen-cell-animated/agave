# agave_pyclient

A Python client for the Agave 3d volume renderer

---

## Features

- Connects to Agave server and sends draw commands. Receives and saves rendered images.

## Quick Start

You must have Agave installed. On command line, run:

```
agave --server &
```

For Linux headless operation, you need to tell the Qt library to use the offscreen platform plugin:

```
agave -platform offscreen --server &
```

```python
from agave_pyclient import AgaveRenderer

# 1. connect to the agave server
r = agave_pyclient.AgaveRenderer()
# 2. tell it what data to load
r.load_data("my_favorite.ome.tiff")
# 3. set some render settings (abbreviated list here)
r.set_resolution(681, 612)
r.background_color(0, 0, 0)
r.render_iterations(128)
r.set_primary_ray_step_size(4)
r.set_secondary_ray_step_size(4)
r.set_voxel_scale(0.270833, 0.270833, 0.53)
r.exposure(0.75)
r.density(28.7678)
# 4. give the output a name
r.session("output.png")
# 5. wait for render and then save output
r.redraw()
```
